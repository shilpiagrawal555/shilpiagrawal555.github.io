Do you think others perceive you to be more intelligent than you really are? Do you feel like an imposter or fraud when you achieve something? Like somehow you didn‚Äôt do anything to deserve that success. Like somehow you just happened to be at the right place at the right time. Do you attribute your achievements primarily to luck or coincidence? If the answer is yes - then, my friend, you sometimes experience imposter syndrome. In this post, I summarize my ways to tackle my own imposter syndrome. </p>\n<p>Impostor experience can make you anxious, stressed, or depressed. It can lower your self-confidence. It can make you miss out on exciting opportunities. It can be detrimental to our mental and emotional state. And.. it is a very common phenomenon. Recently, I was featured in <a href=\"https://inc42.com/features/the-50-coolest-women-in-indias-product-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Inc42 50 Coolest Women In India‚Äôs Product Ecosystem</a> and it made me feel like an imposter among the amazing women leaders. Previously, I felt like an imposter hiding among the most intelligent folks in college. I pondered about this and came up with my own monologue to encourage myself out of imposter syndrome. üëá </p>\n<p>Have confidence. Do away the imposter syndrome. What we get in life is a function of our choices, efforts, surroundings, randomness and a lot of things we have no direct control over. Whatever we get, we get because of a unique combination of these factors. Life decides what to throw at us next with some input (>=0) from us. It all comes together in form of our fate or karma. I‚Äôm a staunch believer of ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§§ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§π‡•ã‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§•‡§æ - ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§ó‡•á ‡§¨‡•ù‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∂‡§ø‡§∂ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§ï‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§õ‡•ã‡•ú‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§®‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§ó‡•á ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§õ‡•ã‡•ú‡•á‡§ó‡•á ‡•§ . We get what is in our individual fate. Nothing more, nothing less. People don‚Äôt always get what they want or need or sometimes what they deserve as well. They get what is in their fate to get. Sometimes, you will get f*cked even if you give your 100% trying to not get f*cked. Other times, life will shower you with amazing things you never even dreamt of or worked towards directly. Stop questioning fate. Stop finding reasons behind every good thing. Stop finding someone or something to blame for every bad thing. Stop thinking about how you got something or why you got something. Focus on the aftermath - what next to do with it. It doesn‚Äôt matter how why you got something or whether you think you deserve it or not. At the risk of sounding extremely redudant - Things happen without a reason sometimes. Stop finding reasons. There are none, at times. Things just are. Not good. Not bad. Not because of. They just are. Focus on what you control directly. </p>\n<p>So, let‚Äôs say you got something amazing unexpectedly. Stop thinking detrimentally about yourself. Take a deep breath, smile and accept what you got. Humility, kindness and gratefulness go a long way. Have faith in yourself. You got it. Use it. End of story. Yes, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you got that IIT seat because of reservation / quota. Yes, it doesn‚Äôt matter if others think you got that job just because you‚Äôre a female (diversity) candidate. Even if that‚Äôs true, it doesn‚Äôt matter. [Getting a job is anyway a highly nuanced process full of randomness and ability to network and showcase oneself]. Yes, it doesn‚Äôt matter if others think you get those followers because of your gender and not because of your content. How you land an opportunity is highly nuanced and irrelevant. There is no outcome in the pursuit of reason here. You don‚Äôt define all the rules. You don‚Äôt know all the rules. And not everything will fit, no matter how much you try to make everything fit your views.</p>\n<p>To quote my 17-year old self </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 33.6%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshilpiagrawal555%2Fposts%2F4832276213106&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share\"></iframe> </div>\n<p>Damn I was more sassy back then :P</p>\n<p>When life gives you lemon, stop asking if you should have gotten a lemon or if you worked hard enough for the lemon or whether you should have gotten a peanut or if someone else deserved that lemon more than you did.

This may get me a lot of anti-nepotism pro-Kangana hate but I‚Äôll risk it. It‚Äôs just an observation, folks - not a commentary on nepotism at all. So, the star kids are born into Bollywood. It‚Äôs something they have 0 contribution in. It‚Äôs easy for them to get into Bollywood. They can feel like they didn‚Äôt do anything at all to deserve this and let imposter syndrome affect them into oblivion OR they can accept that they are given an easy entry into bollywood by fate and then decide what to do with this. They can decide to work on their upskilling. They can create great stuff like Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt or Farhan Akhtar. Another similar inspirational story is of Mukesh Ambani or Kumar Mangalam Birla. Getting a big opportunity is just a starting point of a very long race. Sure, sometimes, people start the race from a point far ahead of others because of things they can‚Äôt control. It‚Äôs not important how you reached a certain point in a race, probably ahead of others. It is important to, however, not forget the long race ahead and not keep looking at similar folks behind them - thinking why and how did they get such an amazing starting point. The race is long. Look ahead. Not behind. </p>\n<p>There are many similar inspirational stories around us - people who did not question why-hows of the past - did not ask if they deserved it or not - but took the success gracefully and planned what next with it. I‚Äôm sure Satya Nadella doesn‚Äôt think of his education from Manipal as much as others in India do. I‚Äôm sure when he was presented with amazing opportunities to grow, he didn‚Äôt let ‚ÄúOh how can I do this - I am not as intelligent as IITians‚Äù ever get in his way ahead. If Yashraj Mukhate had asked ‚Äúis this even music in the real sense? do I deserve to interview the legend A.R Rahman just because I made a funny video which went viral‚Äù - he wouldn‚Äôt be able to define a new genre of music which makes people laugh and consitently release music videos that everyone loves. </p>\n<p><a class=\"twitter-timeline\"  href=\"https://twitter.com/shilpiagrawal55?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">Tweets by shilpiagrawal55</a> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n<p><a class=\"twitter-timeline\" data-width=\"300\" data-height=\"400\" href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterDev\">Tweets by TwitterDev</a> </p>\n<script>!function(d,s,id){var js,fjs=d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0],p=/^http:/.test(d.location)?'http':'https';if(!d.getElementById(id)){js=d.createElement(s);js.id=id;js.src=p+\"://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\";fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js,fjs);}}(document,\"script\",\"twitter-wjs\");</script>"}
