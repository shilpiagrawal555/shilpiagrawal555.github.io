Do you think others perceive you to be more intelligent than you really are? Do you feel like an imposter or fraud when you achieve something? Like somehow you didn’t do anything to deserve that success. Like somehow you just happened to be at the right place at the right time. Do you attribute your achievements primarily to luck or coincidence? If the answer is yes - then, my friend, you sometimes experience imposter syndrome. In this post, I summarize my ways to tackle my own imposter syndrome. </p>\n<p>Impostor experience can make you anxious, stressed, or depressed. It can lower your self-confidence. It can make you miss out on exciting opportunities. It can be detrimental to our mental and emotional state. And.. it is a very common phenomenon. Recently, I was featured in <a href=\"https://inc42.com/features/the-50-coolest-women-in-indias-product-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Inc42 50 Coolest Women In India’s Product Ecosystem</a> and it made me feel like an imposter among the amazing women leaders. Previously, I felt like an imposter hiding among the most intelligent folks in college. I pondered about this and came up with my own monologue to encourage myself out of imposter syndrome. 👇 </p>\n<p>Have confidence. Do away the imposter syndrome. What we get in life is a function of our choices, efforts, surroundings, randomness and a lot of things we have no direct control over. Whatever we get, we get because of a very unique combination of these factors. Life decides what to throw at us next with some input (>=0) from us. It all comes together to form our fate or karma. Nothing in life is given to us which is not in our fate or karma. We get what is in our individual fate. Nothing more, nothing less. People don’t get what they want or need or sometimes what they deserve as well. They get what is in their fate to get. Sometimes, you will get f*cked even if you give your 100% trying to not get f*cked. Other times, life will shower you with amazing things you never even dreamt of or worked towards explicitly. Stop questioning fate. Stop finding reasons behind every good thing and someone to blame for every bad thing. Stop thinking detrimentally about yourself. Take a deep breath, smile and accept what you got. Stay humble, kind and thankful. Have faith in yourself. You got it. Use it. End of story. Stop thinking about how you got something or why you got something. Focus on the aftermath - what next to do with it. It doesn’t matter how why you got something or whether you think you deserve it or not. Things happen without reasons at times basis on multiple choices in the past - sometimes they happen extremely unexpectedly and without reasons. Stop finding reasons behind reaching everything. There are none, at times. Things just are. Not good. Not bad. Not because of. They just are. Focus on what you control directly. When life gives you lemon, stop asking if you should have gotten a lemon or if you worked hard enough for the lemon or whether you should have gotten a peanut or if someone else deserved that lemon more than you did. Just accept the damn lemon and think what to do with it. </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 45.45454545454545%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fshilpiagrawal55%2Fstatus%2F1372136838312329216\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>An inspiration I get is from Bollywood star kids. This may get me a lot of anti-nepotism pro-Kangana hate but I’ll risk it. It’s just an observation, folks - not a commentary on nepotism at all. So, the star kids are born into Bollywood. It’s something they have 0 contribution in. It’s easy for them to get into Bollywood. They can feel like they didn’t do anything at all to deserve this and let imposter syndrome affect them into oblivion OR they can accept that they are given an easy entry into bollywood by fate and then decide what to do with this. They can decide to work on their upskilling. They can create great stuff like Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt or Farhan Akhtar. Another similar inspirational story is of Mukesh Ambani or Kumar Mangalam Birla.</p>\n<p>There are many inspirational stories around us - people who did not question why-hows of the past - did not ask if they deserved it or not - but took the success gracefully and planned what next with it. If Yashraj Mukhate had asked “is this even music in the real sense? do I deserve to interview the legend A.R Rahman just because I made a funny video which went viral” - he wouldn’t be able to define a new genre of music which makes people laugh and consitently release music videos that everyone loves. </p>\n<p>It’s not important how you reached a certain point in a race, probably ahead of others.
