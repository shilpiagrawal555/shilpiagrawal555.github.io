Do you think others perceive you to be more intelligent than you really are? Do you feel like an imposter or fraud when you achieve something? Do you attribute your success to luck or coincidence? If the answer is yes - then, my friend, you sometimes experience imposter syndrome. In this post, I summarize my ways to tackle my own imposter syndrome. </p>\n<p>Impostor experience can make you anxious, stressed, or depressed. It can lower your self-confidence. It can make you miss out on exciting opportunities.\nRecently, I was featured in <a href=\"https://inc42.com/features/the-50-coolest-women-in-indias-product-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Inc42 50 Coolest Women In India’s Product Ecosystem</a> and it made me feel like an imposter among the amazing women leaders. I pondered about this and came up with my own monologue to encourage myself out of imposter syndrome - </p>\n<p>Have confidence. Do away the imposter syndrome. Nothing in life is given to you what you don’t deserve and is not in your fate/karma. Nothing more, nothing less. People don’t get what they want or need. They get what is in their fate/karma to get. Sometimes, you will get f*cked even if you give your 100% trying to not be f*cked. Other times, you will reach success milestones even if you didn’t try explicitly to reach it. Stop questioning fate. Stop thinking detrimentally about yourself. Take a deep breath and be thankful and stay humble. Have faith in yourself. You got it. Use it. End of story. Stop thinking about how you got something or why you got something. Focus on the aftermath - what next to do with it. Also, since you have reached the milestone - just smile and celebrate. It doesn’t matter how why you got something or whether you think you deserve it or not. Things happen without reasons at times basis on multiple choices in the past - sometimes they happen extremely unexpectedly. Stop finding reasons behind reaching every milestone. There are none. Things just are. Not good. Not bad. Not because of. They just are. Focus on what you control directly. When life gives you lemon, stop asking if you should have gotten a lemon or if you worked hard enough for the lemon or whether you should have gotten peanut. Just accept the lemon and think what to do with it. </p>\n<p><em>Originally published by <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/shilpiagrawal55\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Shilpi Agrawal</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shilpiagrawal55/status/1357465595013341186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>"}
