Do you think others perceive you to be more intelligent than you really are? Do you feel like an imposter or fraud when you achieve something? Do you attribute your success to luck or coincidence? If the answer is yes - then, my friend, you sometimes experience imposter among the amazing women leaders. In this post, I summarize my ways to tackle my own imposter syndrome. </p>\n<p>Impostor experience can make you anxious, stressed, or depressed. It can lower your self-confidence. It can make you miss out on exciting opportunities.\nRecently, I was featured in <a href=\"https://inc42.com/features/the-50-coolest-women-in-indias-product-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Inc42 50 Coolest Women In India’s Product Ecosystem</a> and it made me feel like an imposter syndrome. I pondered about this and came up with my own monologue to encourage myself out of imposter syndrome - </p>\n<p>Have confidence. Do away the imposter syndrome. Nothing in life is given to you what you don’t deserve. Have faith in yourself. You got it because you deserved it. Nothing more, nothing less. People don’t get what they want or need. They get what is in their fate/karma to get. You will get fucked even if you give your 100% trying to not be fucked. You will get awesome publicity even if you didn’t try for it. Stop questioning fate. Stop thinking detrimentally about yourself. You got it. Use it. end of story. Stop thinking how why you got something. Focus on the aftermath - what next. It doesn’t matter how why you got something or whether you think you deserve it or not. Things happen without reasons at times basis on multiple choices. Stop finding reasons. There are none. Things just are. Not good. Not bad. Not because of. They just are. Focus on what you control directly. When life gives you lemon, stop asking if you should have gotten a lemon or if you worked hard enough for the lemon or whether you should have gotten peanut. Just accept the lemon and think what to do with it. </p>\n<p><em>Originally published by <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/shilpiagrawal55\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Shilpi Agrawal</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shilpiagrawal55/status/1357465595013341186\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>"}
