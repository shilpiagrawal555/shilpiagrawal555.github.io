Do you think others perceive you to be more intelligent than you really are? Do you feel like an imposter or fraud when you achieve something? Do you attribute your success to luck or coincidence? If the answer is yes - then, my friend, you sometimes experience imposter syndrome. In this post, I summarize my ways to tackle my own imposter syndrome. </p>\n<p>Impostor experience can make you anxious, stressed, or depressed. It can lower your self-confidence. It can make you miss out on exciting opportunities.\nRecently, I was featured in <a href=\"https://inc42.com/features/the-50-coolest-women-in-indias-product-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Inc42 50 Coolest Women In India’s Product Ecosystem</a> and it made me feel like an imposter among the amazing women leaders. I pondered about this and came up with my own monologue to encourage myself out of imposter syndrome - </p>\n<p>Have confidence. Do away the imposter syndrome. What we get in life is a function of our choices, efforts, surroundings, and a lot of randomness we have no control over(things we can’t figure out always). Whatever we get is a combination of these with different weights. All of these form our fate/karma. Nothing in life is given to you which is not in your fate/karma. Nothing more, nothing less. People don’t get what they want or need. They get what is in their fate/karma to get. Sometimes, you will get f*cked even if you give your 100% trying to not be f*cked. Other times, you will reach success milestones even if you didn’t try explicitly to reach it. Stop questioning fate. Stop thinking detrimentally about yourself. Take a deep breath, smile and accept what you got. Stay humble, kind and thankful. Have faith in yourself. You got it. Use it. End of story. Stop thinking about how you got something or why you got something. Focus on the aftermath - what next to do with it. It doesn’t matter how why you got something or whether you think you deserve it or not. Things happen without reasons at times basis on multiple choices in the past - sometimes they happen extremely unexpectedly and without reasons. Stop finding reasons behind reaching everything. There are none, at times. Things just are. Not good. Not bad. Not because of. They just are. Focus on what you control directly. When life gives you lemon, stop asking if you should have gotten a lemon or if you worked hard enough for the lemon or whether you should have gotten a peanut or if someone else deserved that lemon more than you did. Just accept the damn lemon and think what to do with it. </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\" style=\"padding-bottom: 45.45454545454545%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\" > <iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fshilpiagrawal55%2Fstatus%2F1372136838312329216\" style=\" position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; \"></iframe> </div>\n<p>An inspiration I get is from Bollywood star kids. This may get me a lot of anti-nepotism pro-Kangana hate but I’ll risk it. It’s just an observation, folks - not a commentary on nepotism at all. So, the star kids are born into Bollywood. It’s something they have 0 contribution in. It’s easy for them to get into Bollywood. They can feel like they didn’t do anything at all to deserve this and let imposter syndrome affect them into oblivion OR they can accept that they are given an easy entry into bollywood by fate and then decide what to do with this. They can decide to work on their upskilling. They can create great stuff like Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt or Farhan Akhtar. Another similar inspirational story is of Mukesh Ambani or Kumar Mangalam Birla.</p>\n<p>There are many inspirational stories around us - people who did not question why-hows of the past - did not ask if they deserved it or not - but took the success gracefully and planned what next with it. If Yashraj Mukhate had asked “is this even music in the real sense? do I deserve to interview the legend A.R Rahman just because I made a funny video which went viral” - he wouldn’t be able to define a new genre of music which makes people laugh and consitently release music videos that everyone loves. </p>\n<p>It’s not important how you reached a certain point in a race, probably ahead of others. It is important to, however, </p>"}
