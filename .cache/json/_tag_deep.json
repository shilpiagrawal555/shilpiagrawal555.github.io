This poem is an attempt to address overarching dilemmas. It's an attempt to ask the moral, philosophical and ethical questions. A world-full of people moving towards stress and anxiety, the poem asks some ignored questions. I hope our poem reaches some people asking difficult questions in life."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/nirbhaya","categorySlug":"/category/poems/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Nirbhaya","date":"2012-02-20T00:00:00.001Z","category":"Poems","description":"A peom written by me telling the story of a young girl. 'Nearly four out of five women in India have faced public harassment ranging from staring, insults and wolf-whistling to being followed, groped or even raped', said a survey by the charity ActionAid UK in 2016. The poem tries to bring out a story of one such shattering experience.
