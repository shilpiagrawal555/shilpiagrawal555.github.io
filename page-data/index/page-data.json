This poem is an attempt to address overarching dilemmas, attempt to ask the moral, philosophical and ethical questions. A world-full of people moving towards increasing stress and anxiety, the poem lists down all ignored questions which may give a sense of relief to some of you that you're not alone asking yourself all these random questions. Maybe we're together in the unknown. Maybe we're together in this dilemma. I hope this reaches some people looking for answers to difficult questions in life or just reaches people looking for others asking the same questions.
