dreams that see\nBut that can’t be for I can be free\nThen must I exist in my reverie?</p>\n<p>Am I my body, my face, my hair?\nThat is what attracts the most glare\nBut how can that be me\nIf I need to look at a mirror to see</p>\n<p>Then I must be a bit of her or him\nFor I talk of their interests and them\nThey built pieces of me like many more\nCan i be so many yet have my own core?</p>\n<p>I wonder what might be the nature of my core\nDoes it include my qualities like my quality of wanting more?\nOr is my core made of my philosophy, my principles, my morality?\nBut what exactly are these in reality?\nDoes there exist an SI unit of someone’s core?\nBecause in life, I have seen immorable people soar\nThe truthful, naive moral people others abhor</p>\n<p>But does it matter who they despise?\nWhy should I ever chastise\nVirtues of mine were in my wise\nNot a stepping stone for me to rise\nWhy then should I mourn their superiority?\nIs it not my heart’s depravity,\nTo seek something of my purity\nContradicting to a point of immorality?</p>\n<p>Maybe I am the role I play in this world\nBut isn’t this role just a role which at me life hurled?\nIf I consider the world a big stage, what role do I anyway play?\nAm I just a passer-by to the billion lives or am I gonna stay?\nIf I zoom out of my city, state, country, continent, planet and see the vast empty space\nDoes it matter to the space what is my career pace?\nWhat is the reason for my existence?\nIs the reason just to ponder over this question with persistence?\nAm I just one of the million atoms floating around in the vast universe?\nOr am I the money gloating around in my tiny purse?\nThey say people find soulmates and marry them\nThey must be seeing my soul before marrying\nThen my soul must be defined by the money I am carrying</p>\n<p>Or maybe I am too small to know\nThe truth that runs all this show\nTo keep the glory intact\nThere are trifles that distract\nBut how could I know if I fall\nA prey to these frivolity’s call</p>\n<p>Let me start by enslaving the master\nThe mind that controls shall be the prisoner\nSo that I can break out of the teachings\nBecause it definitely triggers my musings\nOnly when I unlearn will I begin to learn\nWhat my notions have kept hidden</p>\n<p>What defines me, I shall set free\nHey me, It’s an open minded quest for thee\nRather than blindly following the norms\nThou shalt question everything in all the forms\nThou shan’t have to follow the conventional cycle of life\nBirth, Studies, Job, and then a wife</p>\n<p>The process of unlearning is more difficult than learning\nSitting idle is more difficult than earning\nSqueezing the paste inside is more difficult than taking it out\nBeing silent is more powerful than your shout\nForgetting something is more difficult than creating memories\nWriting a poem is less expensive than a therapist’s fees</p>\n<p>I am learning to unlearn what I earlier learnt\nNot use the fancy words, I want to be blunt\nThe existential crisis that has become the common identity\nA place where you are judged by your prosperity\nNot your perspective but your money matters\nNot your morals but your gold chatters\nWe are a population divided by money but united by existential crisis\nWho is it sitting in the sky playing the dices?\nMy cluttered thoughts are turning a tad bit more into a clutter\nThey are following the pattern of a naive butterfly’s flutter</p>\n<p>Although my mind is still a muddle\nAnd I have no answer to life’s puzzle\nI’ve learnt to find order in the chaos\nTaking each day as the life throws </p>\n<p>The gibberish I see is a pattern\nWhich can only be seen if I leave my dark cavern\nIf I zoom out for a second and try to see\nThe beautiful pattern is always smiling at me\nThe nature has it all figured out\nIt does the best for us, without a doubt\nFor sudden turns, everyone curse, blame, cry and everyone clings\nOnly to later realise the greater scheme of things\nYou can’t see the design and you whine\nYou are the ant which sees from the FOV nature assign\nBut someday you will realise\nAll your life events are a boon in disguise\nAll that happens with you, has a purpose and a noble reason\nIf there is winter, always comes a  spring season</p>\n<p>Wait, is it a validation that I seek from others\nIs that why I live, my being shudders\nA person telling me that yes, I am insanely good\nIsn’t that all we seek in adulthood\nDo I just seek an acceptance in this society\nA boost to my ego and my vanity\nMaybe that is why I do inhuman things- to gel well\nBecause gel-ing well is more important that skipping hell\nDoes my whole sense of being revolve around looking cool\nIf my life is a car, is admiration the only fuel?</p>\n<p>Ah, any interesting analogy of my life being a car!\nFuel stations may sometimes be near and sometimes far\nThe fuel may be a happy memory, a tiny success, a good conversation\nSomething which keeps me going till the next station\nA constant love amounts a lot\nIf something feels right, it’s worth a shot\nA bumpy ride sometimes till I hit the highway road\nSometimes the fuel might end and I may need to be towed\nSometimes all I require is a small push or kick start acceleration\nA push which leads me to my destination\nOr maybe just sends me to next station</p>\n<p>My mind, you see, is full of chaos\nThe universe might have said “You want me to increase entropy? - Here goes”\nI wonder if the stable mind is better than a chaotic one\nI wonder how does the stable one have some fun\nOr maybe it is a matter of multiple states of mind\nWhere it goes through happiness, sadness and rewind</p>\n<p>Lack of reference frame renders the question “Who am I” pointless\nWho is supposed to answer - you need to address\nFor a wife, you are a husband\nFor a friend, you are a friend\nFor a daughter, you are a mother\nFor a sister, you are a brother</p>\n<p>If the question is aimed at you, yourself\nIts a loop within a loop itself\nYou can’t say ‘to publish something’ is definition of ‘publication’\nYou don’t say ‘to converse’ means ‘having a conversation’\nI am asking myself that who am I\nIf I know where my thoughts generate, it will simplify\nWhere am I actually expecting the answer from is the answer in itself\nWhich component is answering that within myself\nMaybe I am my brain, or maybe I am my mind\nWhere is this thought originating from is what I need to find\nI maybe am my heart, or maybe my conscience\nOr maybe I will find out with some advancements in science</p>\n<p>But one thing I know for sure is that I am deeper than my skin\nA vessel and what’s inside the vessel can not always be akin\nAlthough the structure or material might tell you a lot or might not\nIt’s definitely not all what a vessel has got\nBut I wonder why we put all our time to keep the vessel shining\nWhy not spend more time in thinking and thoughts mining\nMaybe because nobody is ready to climb up and peep inside the vessel\nAs it may be causing a lot of hassle\nEvery hemisphere requires another one to complete a closed sphere\nMaybe being with someone is the law of nature and it’s only fair\nI would have left my thoughts to wander more, but I do not dare\nIn getting distracted, I have a natural flair</p>\n<p>Maybe the distraction is the real order and the real order a distraction\nMaybe a dream is a reality and reality a dream in action\nAt this point, I think I should take a bath\nTo save myself from my mother’s telephonic wrath\nHopefully, I have confused you a lot\nYou’ll miss me in the 2050 - the world of bot!</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/who-am-i","tagSlugs":["/tag/poem/","/tag/who-am-i/","/tag/philosophy/","/tag/existential-crisis/","/tag/deep/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-02-18T00:00:00.001Z","description":"A beautifully long poem written by Shaista and I depicting the haphazard, clogged, jumbled up internal existential crisis in our minds. This poem is an attempt to address overarching dilemmas, attempt to ask the moral, philosophical and ethical questions. A world-full of people moving towards increasing stress and anxiety, the poem lists down all ignored questions which may give a sense of relief to some of you that you're not alone asking yourself all these random questions. Maybe we're together in the unknown. Maybe we're together in this dilemma. I hope this reaches some people looking for answers to difficult questions in life or just reaches people looking for others asking the same questions.
