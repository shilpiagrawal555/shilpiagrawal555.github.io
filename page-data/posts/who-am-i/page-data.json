This poem is an attempt to address overarching dilemmas. It’s an attempt to ask the moral, philosophical and ethical questions. A world-full of people moving towards stress and anxiety, the poem asks some ignored questions. I hope our poem reaches some people asking difficult questions in life.</p>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<p>Am I these strings that bind me?<br>\nErasing my dreams that see<br>\nBut that can’t be for I can be free<br>\nThen must I exist in my reverie?    </p>\n<p>Am I my body, my face, my hair?<br>\nThat is what attracts the most glare<br>\nBut how can that be me<br>\nIf I need to look at a mirror to see   </p>\n<p>Then I must be a bit of her or him<br>\nFor I talk of their interests and them<br>\nThey built pieces of me like many more<br>\nCan i be so many yet have my own core?   </p>\n<p>I wonder what might be the nature of my core<br>\nDoes it include my qualities like my quality of wanting more?<br>\nOr is my core made of my philosophy, my principles, my morality?<br>\nBut what exactly are these in reality?<br>\nDoes there exist an SI unit of someone’s core?<br>\nBecause in life, I have seen immorable people soar<br>\nThe truthful, naive moral people others abhor   </p>\n<p>But does it matter who they despise?<br>\nWhy should I ever chastise<br>\nVirtues of mine were in my wise<br>\nNot a stepping stone for me to rise<br>\nWhy then should I mourn their superiority?<br>\nIs it not my heart’s depravity,<br>\nTo seek something of my purity<br>\nContradicting to a point of immorality?   </p>\n<p>Maybe I am the role I play in this world<br>\nBut isn’t this role just a role which at me life hurled?<br>\nIf I consider the world a big stage, what role do I anyway play?<br>\nAm I just a passer-by to the billion lives or am I gonna stay?<br>\nIf I zoom out of my city, state, country, continent, planet and see the vast empty space<br>\nDoes it matter to the space what is my career pace?<br>\nWhat is the reason for my existence?<br>\nIs the reason just to ponder over this question with persistence?<br>\nAm I just one of the million atoms floating around in the vast universe?<br>\nOr am I the money gloating around in my tiny purse?<br>\nThey say people find soulmates and marry them<br>\nThey must be seeing my soul before marrying<br>\nThen my soul must be defined by the money I am carrying   </p>\n<p>Or maybe I am too small to know<br>\nThe truth that runs all this show<br>\nTo keep the glory intact<br>\nThere are trifles that distract<br>\nBut how could I know if I fall<br>\nA prey to these frivolity’s call   </p>\n<p>Let me start by enslaving the master<br>\nThe mind that controls shall be the prisoner<br>\nSo that I can break out of the teachings<br>\nBecause it definitely triggers my musings<br>\nOnly when I unlearn will I begin to learn<br>\nWhat my notions have kept hidden   </p>\n<p>What defines me, I shall set free<br>\nHey me, It’s an open minded quest for thee<br>\nRather than blindly following the norms<br>\nThou shalt question everything in all the forms<br>\nThou shan’t have to follow the conventional cycle of life<br>\nBirth, Studies, Job, and then a wife   </p>\n<p>The process of unlearning is more difficult than learning<br>\nSitting idle is more difficult than earning<br>\nSqueezing the paste inside is more difficult than taking it out<br>\nBeing silent is more powerful than your shout<br>\nForgetting something is more difficult than creating memories<br>\nWriting a poem is less expensive than a therapist’s fees   </p>\n<p>I am learning to unlearn what I earlier learnt<br>\nNot use the fancy words, I want to be blunt<br>\nThe existential crisis that has become the common identity<br>\nA place where you are judged by your prosperity<br>\nNot your perspective but your money matters<br>\nNot your morals but your gold chatters<br>\nWe are a population divided by money but united by existential crisis<br>\nWho is it sitting in the sky playing the dices?<br>\nMy cluttered thoughts are turning a tad bit more into a clutter<br>\nThey are following the pattern of a naive butterfly’s flutter   </p>\n<p>Although my mind is still a muddle<br>\nAnd I have no answer to life’s puzzle<br>\nI’ve learnt to find order in the chaos<br>\nTaking each day as the life throws    </p>\n<p>The gibberish I see is a pattern<br>\nWhich can only be seen if I leave my dark cavern<br>\nIf I zoom out for a second and try to see<br>\nThe beautiful pattern is always smiling at me<br>\nThe nature has it all figured out<br>\nIt does the best for us, without a doubt<br>\nFor sudden turns, everyone curse, blame, cry and everyone clings<br>\nOnly to later realise the greater scheme of things<br>\nYou can’t see the design and you whine<br>\nYou are the ant which sees from the FOV nature assign<br>\nBut someday you will realise<br>\nAll your life events are a boon in disguise<br>\nAll that happens with you, has a purpose and a noble reason<br>\nIf there is winter, always comes a  spring season   </p>\n<p>Wait, is it a validation that I seek from others<br>\nIs that why I live, my being shudders<br>\nA person telling me that yes, I am insanely good<br>\nIsn’t that all we seek in adulthood<br>\nDo I just seek an acceptance in this society<br>\nA boost to my ego and my vanity<br>\nMaybe that is why I do inhuman things- to gel well<br>\nBecause gel-ing well is more important that skipping hell<br>\nDoes my whole sense of being revolve around looking cool<br>\nIf my life is a car, is admiration the only fuel?   </p>\n<p>Ah, any interesting analogy of my life being a car!<br>\nFuel stations may sometimes be near and sometimes far<br>\nThe fuel may be a happy memory, a tiny success, a good conversation<br>\nSomething which keeps me going till the next station<br>\nA constant love amounts a lot<br>\nIf something feels right, it’s worth a shot<br>\nA bumpy ride sometimes till I hit the highway road<br>\nSometimes the fuel might end and I may need to be towed<br>\nSometimes all I require is a small push or kick start acceleration<br>\nA push which leads me to my destination<br>\nOr maybe just sends me to next station   </p>\n<p>My mind, you see, is full of chaos<br>\nThe universe might have said “You want me to increase entropy? - Here goes”<br>\nI wonder if the stable mind is better than a chaotic one<br>\nI wonder how does the stable one have some fun<br>\nOr maybe it is a matter of multiple states of mind<br>\nWhere it goes through happiness, sadness and rewind   </p>\n<p>Lack of reference frame renders the question “Who am I” pointless<br>\nWho is supposed to answer - you need to address<br>\nFor a wife, you are a husband<br>\nFor a friend, you are a friend<br>\nFor a daughter, you are a mother<br>\nFor a sister, you are a brother   </p>\n<p>If the question is aimed at you, yourself<br>\nIts a loop within a loop itself<br>\nYou can’t say ‘to publish something’ is definition of ‘publication’<br>\nYou don’t say ‘to converse’ means ‘having a conversation’<br>\nI am asking myself that who am I<br>\nIf I know where my thoughts generate, it will simplify<br>\nWhere am I actually expecting the answer from is the answer in itself<br>\nWhich component is answering that within myself<br>\nMaybe I am my brain, or maybe I am my mind<br>\nWhere is this thought originating from is what I need to find<br>\nI maybe am my heart, or maybe my conscience<br>\nOr maybe I will find out with some advancements in science   </p>\n<p>But one thing I know for sure is that I am deeper than my skin<br>\nA vessel and what’s inside the vessel can not always be akin<br>\nAlthough the structure or material might tell you a lot or might not<br>\nIt’s definitely not all what a vessel has got<br>\nBut I wonder why we put all our time to keep the vessel shining<br>\nWhy not spend more time in thinking and thoughts mining<br>\nMaybe because nobody is ready to climb up and peep inside the vessel<br>\nAs it may be causing a lot of hassle<br>\nEvery hemisphere requires another one to complete a closed sphere<br>\nMaybe being with someone is the law of nature and it’s only fair<br>\nI would have left my thoughts to wander more, but I do not dare<br>\nIn getting distracted, I have a natural flair   </p>\n<p>Maybe the distraction is the real order and the real order a distraction<br>\nMaybe a dream is a reality and reality a dream in action<br>\nAt this point, I think I should take a bath<br>\nTo save myself from my mother’s telephonic wrath<br>\nHopefully, I have confused you a lot<br>\nYou’ll miss me in the 2050 - the world of bot!   </p>\n</div>\n<p><em>Originally published by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/shilpiagrawal555/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Shilpi Agrawal</a> on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/shilpi-agrawal/who-am-i/2069914386368995\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Facebook</a>.</em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/who-am-i","tagSlugs":["/tag/poem/","/tag/who-am-i/","/tag/philosophy/","/tag/existential-crisis/","/tag/deep/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-02-18T00:00:00.001Z","description":"A long poem written by Shaista and I depicting the haphazard, clogged, jumbled up internal existential crisis.
