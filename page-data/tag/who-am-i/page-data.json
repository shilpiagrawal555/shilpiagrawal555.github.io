This poem is an attempt to address overarching dilemmas. It's an attempt to ask the moral, philosophical and ethical questions. A world-full of people moving towards stress and anxiety, the poem asks some ignored questions. I hope our poem reaches some people asking difficult questions in life."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Who Am I","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/who-am-i","nextPagePath":"/tag/who-am-i/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","79643557"]}
