  &lt;figcaption&gt;Kya aapko bhi imposter syndrome hain?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you sometimes doubt your skills or competence? Do you think others perceive you to be more intelligent than you really are? Do you feel like an imposter or fraud when you achieve something? Like somehow you didn‚Äôt do anything to deserve that success. Like somehow you just happened to be at the right place at the right time. Do you attribute your achievements primarily to luck or coincidence? If the answer is yes - then, my friend, you sometimes experience imposter syndrome. In this post, I summarize my ways to tackle my own imposter syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impostor experience can make you anxious, stressed, or depressed. It can lower your self-confidence. It can make you miss out on exciting opportunities. It can be detrimental to your mental and emotional state. And.. it is a very common phenomenon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to flex, but recently, I was featured in &lt;a href=&quot;https://inc42.com/features/the-50-coolest-women-in-indias-product-ecosystem/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Inc42 50 Coolest Women In India‚Äôs Product Ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; and it made me feel like an imposter among the amazing women leaders present here. Like somehow I was not deserving of this limelight. Previously, I have felt like an imposter hiding among the most intelligent folks in college. I pondered about this and came up with my own monologue to encourage myself out of imposter syndrome. üëá &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have confidence. Do away the imposter syndrome.&lt;/strong&gt; What we get in life is a function of our choices, efforts, surroundings, randomness and a lot of things we have no direct control over. Whatever we get, we get because of a unique combination of these factors. Life decides what to throw at us next with some input (&gt;=0) from us. It all comes together in form of our fate or karma. I‚Äôm a staunch believer of ‡§ï‡§ø‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§§ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§•‡§æ ‡§§‡•ã ‡§π‡•ã‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§•‡§æ - ‡§¨‡§æ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§Ü‡§ó‡•á ‡§¨‡•ù‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ã‡§∂‡§ø‡§∂ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ã‡§à ‡§ï‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä‡§Ç ‡§õ‡•ã‡•ú‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§®‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§ó‡•á ‡§ï‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§õ‡•ã‡§°‡•Ç‡§ó‡•Ä ‡•§ . We get what is in our fate. Nothing more, nothing less. People don‚Äôt always get what they want or need or sometimes what they deserve as well. They get what is in their fate to get. Sometimes, you will get f*cked even if you give your 100% trying to not get f*cked. Other times, life will shower you with amazing things you never even dreamt of or worked towards directly. &lt;strong&gt;Stop questioning fate. Stop finding reasons behind every good thing.&lt;/strong&gt; Stop finding someone or something to blame for every bad thing. Stop thinking about how you got something or why you got something. Focus on the aftermath - what next to do with it. It doesn‚Äôt matter how why you got something or whether you think you deserve it or not. At the risk of sounding extremely redudant - &lt;strong&gt;Things happen without a reason sometimes. Stop finding reasons. There are none, at times. Things just are. Not good. Not bad. Not because of. They just are. Focus on what you control directly.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let‚Äôs say you got something amazing unexpectedly. &lt;strong&gt;Stop thinking detrimentally about yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; Take a deep breath, smile and accept what you got. Humility, kindness and gratefulness go a long way. Have faith in yourself. &lt;strong&gt;You got it. Use it. End of story.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you got that IIT seat because of reservation / quota. Yes, it doesn‚Äôt matter if others think you got that job just because you‚Äôre a female (diversity) candidate. Even if that‚Äôs true, it doesn‚Äôt matter. [Getting a job is anyway a highly nuanced process full of randomness and ability to network and showcase oneself]. Yes, it doesn‚Äôt matter if others think you get those followers because of your gender and not because of your content. Yes, it doesn‚Äôt matter if others think your startup is successful only because you are rich. How you land an opportunity is highly nuanced and irrelevant. There is no outcome in the pursuit of reason here. You don‚Äôt define all the rules. You don‚Äôt know all the rules. And not everything will fit, no matter how much you try to make everything fit into blocks called ‚Äúreasons‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To quote my 17-year old self &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;padding-bottom: 16%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem&quot; &gt; &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fshilpiagrawal555%2Fposts%2F4832276213106&amp;amp;show_text=true&amp;amp;width=500&quot; style=&quot;border:none;overflow:hidden; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; &quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Damn I was more sassy back then :P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An inspiration I get is from Bollywood star kids. This may get me a lot of anti-nepotism pro-Kangana hate but I‚Äôll risk it. It‚Äôs just an observation, folks - not a commentary on nepotism at all. So, the star kids are born into Bollywood. They have 0 contribution in being born into a Bollywood family. It‚Äôs easy for them to get into Bollywood. They can feel like they didn‚Äôt do anything at all to deserve this and let imposter syndrome push them into oblivion OR they can accept that they are given an easy entry into bollywood by fate and then decide what to do with this. They can decide to upskill. They can create great stuff like Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt or Farhan Akhtar. Another similar inspirational story is of Mukesh Ambani or Kumar Mangalam Birla. Getting a big opportunity is just a starting point of a very long race. Sure, sometimes, people start the race from a point far ahead of others because of things they can‚Äôt control. It‚Äôs not important how you landed at a certain point in a race, probably ahead of others. It is important to, however, not forget the long race ahead. It is important to not keep looking at similar folks behind - thinking ‚Äújeez why and how did I get such an amazing starting point‚Äù. Focus on whats important. The race is long. Look ahead often. Not behind that often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many similar inspirational stories around us - people who did not get lost in whys and hows of the past - did not throw away something thinking if they deserved it or not - but took the success gracefully and planned what next. I‚Äôm sure Satya Nadella doesn‚Äôt think of his education from Manipal as much as others in India do. I‚Äôm sure when he was presented with amazing opportunities to grow, he didn‚Äôt let ‚ÄúOh how can I do this - I am not as intelligent as an IITian colleague‚Äù ever get in his way ahead. If Yashraj Mukhate had asked ‚Äúis this even music in the real sense? do I deserve to interview the legend A.R Rahman just because I made a funny video which went viral‚Äù - he wouldn‚Äôt be able to define a new genre of music which makes people laugh and probably would not be able to consistently release music videos that everyone loves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm going to end this post with my favourite analogy to think of imposter syndrome - &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When life gives you lemon, stop asking if you should have gotten a lemon or if you worked hard enough for the lemon or whether you should have gotten a peanut or if someone else deserved that lemon more than you did. Just accept the damn lemon and think what to do with it. Focus on the aftermath - what next. It doesn‚Äôt matter how why you got something or whether you think you deserve it or not. Think what to do with the opportunity which presented itself. Stop finding reasons behind everything good life throws at you. Stop questioning life and telling life that it has probably made a grave mistake sending that lemon your way while targeting someone with similar name or face.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

What is the disease? How do I measure? What is the cure? What can I do? Aim is to share and increase awareness and help if possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: I am NOT a doctor. This info should be verified by you. Its based on my personal experience. I am sharing the basics I learnt the hard way. Info may be wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1/ Covid is a &lt;strong&gt;lungs‚Äô disease&lt;/strong&gt;. The virus damages one‚Äôs lungs. The extent of this damage may be dependent on age, gender, pre-existing conditions (specially diabetes cuz your sugar go high in covid). Novelty of the disease asks me to highlight the keyword ‚Äúmay‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2/ If your lungs get damaged to a huge extent (think 50%+), there are no quick solutions. It‚Äôs not math that it will take x days to repair y% damage. Body doesn‚Äôt function like that. &lt;strong&gt;Lungs auto-heal&lt;/strong&gt;. Naturally. Over time. Days, weeks, months, years. Sometimes, they don‚Äôt as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3/ Timing in Covid is extremely important. D0, D1, D2..D14..D20.. of you catching the virus. After 14-20 days, the virus leaves your body but it already does the damage it had to do in those 15-20 days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4/ In 15-20 days, your &lt;strong&gt;lungs are damaged at very high rate&lt;/strong&gt;, hence timing is extremely important. It may happen that on D5 you have mild damage and on D20 you have damage so severe that it may be fatal. So, &lt;em&gt;every single day&lt;/em&gt; the lung is getting damaged at high rate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5/ Once you get covid, covid negative or positive isn‚Äôt imp except for not spreading it and containing the virus. Covid is like a ball hitting a glass (your lungs). The ball will hit and leave. The glass is broken and needs repair. Quoting a doc. So, duck to miss the ball (mask)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6/ &lt;strong&gt;How do I know what is the extent of damage?&lt;/strong&gt;
CT Scan shows you severity score which tells the lung involvement / damage. You start seeing symptoms like decline in oxygen levels, difficulty in breathing, chest pain if your lungs get more and more damaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7/ If there are symptoms - condition of lungs can be measured with CT Scan, Lung X-Ray, blood tests, ABG reports (informs about your blood oxygen, CO2 levels), D-Dimer (blood clotting), IL6 (inflammation), PCT (bacterial sepsis/bacterial infection in blood)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8/ Instant metrics - Respiratory rate (RR) - number of breaths you take per minute increases from normal indicating load on your lungs increased, spO2 - blood oxygen level decreases (can be measured with a oxymeter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9/ &lt;strong&gt;What is the cure?&lt;/strong&gt;
With covid, there is no cure as such. Lungs auto-heal. All one has to do is keep blood oxygen level sustainable to support all bodily functions until lungs heal and oxygen is not a problem. Enter oxygen support / ventilators / therapy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10/ In case of mild to high damage to lungs and the lungs not being able to pump up enough oxygen, you need to start getting direct oxygen through a low-flow/high-flow mask attached to some oxygen supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11/ If situation becomes worse and high-flow oxygen is not able to support enough to get your oxygen to sustainable levels, you require ventilation. Non-invasive or invasive (which is kind of the last resort). But, small % of people reach this unfortunate state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12/ Meanwhile, there are couple of things which are being done-Plasma Therapy (injecting antibodies from someone cured). This only makes sense in initial ~10 days of one getting the disease, cuz this only stops the virus and kills it. So, if done earlier, the damage may reduce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13/ This has not been &lt;em&gt;proven&lt;/em&gt; to have any great results. Remember, covid is pretty novel. We still don‚Äôt exactly know what works. Randomized controlled trials are WIP. That is why WHO keeps disowning cures. They can‚Äôt back something without statistical proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14/ There is a nation-wide protocol (world-wide?) which is followed for covid cases as there is no exact cure. I‚Äôm attaching the protocol I have from Nov‚Äô20 (may have changed) - &lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyurl.com/sj72gpyk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://tinyurl.com/sj72gpyk&lt;/a&gt;. By protocol, I mean -you‚Äôve x symptom/y test result -&gt; you get z treatment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15/ &lt;strong&gt;What can I do?&lt;/strong&gt;
Step 1 - Don‚Äôt go out unless necessary / you‚Äôve antibodies / vaccination done. If necessary, wear N95+surgical mask. Not the simple clothes mask but N95, if possible. Take the virus seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16/ Step 1 cont If you‚Äôre living with family with people 40+, then please don‚Äôt go out. People above 50 &amp;#x26; infact males (read a legit study) are most vulnerable. Obviously, females and 40- are too at high risk, but please think about the most vulnerable if that helps in not going&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17/ Step 2 in case you get the disease, or even slightest cough or fever or fatigue, isolate yourself. It spreads faster than fire. Contain if you can, however much you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18/ Step 2 cont Don‚Äôt shy away from getting a test done - knowing you have covid will make your job easier with meds, diet, mindset etc. Remember, initial 15 days are important and stuff is to be done - don‚Äôt be in denial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19/ Step 3 In case of covid- get an oxymeter, thermometer and see a doctor to get the medicines. Take these medicines diligently. Keep checking your oxymeter. Consult doctor everyday. Get admitted to a hospital in case symptoms grow. Better to be around all necessary things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20/ Step 4 Keep your diet in check. Drink loads of hot fluids. I think this part is easily available on the internet. Take steam. Eat citrus fruits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;21/ Step 5 SLEEP IN PRONE POSITION. TURNED POSITION. SLEEP ON YOUR CHEST. If not, sleep sideways. I cannot emphasise this enough. I do not know many people who know the value of this. Patients on ventilator are also made to be slept turned in prone position. That‚Äôs the only cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;22/ Don‚Äôt believe me on the importance of the above? Search up ‚Äúprone positioning‚Äù. It‚Äôs one of the effective ways (though certain risks). Lungs actually lie towards the back of our body more than front - so, it helps lung heal. Afaik.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;23/ Step 6 Again an extremely important step : Breathing exercises. There are YouTube videos around this. Tutorials. Do these exercises. Long breaths. If you need a device, they are cheaply available on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;24/ The last suggestion around what one can do would be don‚Äôt forget the body post covid. Have seen many post covid (2 months after covid is over) complications. UTI. Dengue. Random diseases. Try to take care post covid as well. Easy to say, hard to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fin.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;Professional networking? &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Whenever somebody has to connect professionally, they provide their LinkedIn details. I, on the contrary, tend to recommend people to avoid LinkedIn to get in touch with me because I tend to avoid LinkedIn as much as possible. I often get asked the reason for this. Why do I avoid LinkedIn as much as possible? As a LinkedIn user, these are some of the reasons I avoid using LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;linkedin-messaging&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#linkedin-messaging&quot; aria-label=&quot;linkedin messaging permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;LinkedIn Messaging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disorganised inbox and no discouragement of spamming behaviour together curtails the possibility of genuine conversations. Whenever I open my LinkedIn messages, I see messages from variety of people seeking job opportunities, messages from variety of people with job opportunities for me, messages from variety of people looking forward to connect with me and messages which are somewhat random, vague, weird and sometimes just inappropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn isn‚Äôt designed in a way to inherently tackle a couple of problems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spamming&lt;/i&gt; : Doesn‚Äôt discourage users from sending the same message to multiple people &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spamming&lt;/i&gt;: Doesn‚Äôt discourage users from sending the same message multiple times to the same person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disorganisation&lt;/i&gt;: Doesn‚Äôt have an auto-labelling or filtering system. Doesn‚Äôt even have a user-defined labelling or filtering system (except archiving which revives on another message)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disorganisation&lt;/i&gt;: Makes the user go through the reporting flow for filtering out unwarranted messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disorganisation&lt;/i&gt;: Doesn‚Äôt have a way to highlight an important message or conversation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disorganisation&lt;/i&gt;: Doesn‚Äôt have a way to establish credibility of the message sender. CEO of LinkedIn sends me a message vs a random stranger sends me a message - it treats both of them equally which is not a real life mimicry of a professional network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above problems together ends up in making a recipient‚Äôs life difficult and people generally end up having difficulty in identifying genuine connections and conversations in LinkedIn inbox. I‚Äôd be very interested to look at the data of % of messages replied by normal user as well as users who are on top positions in their career. I doubt if people reply to any message on LinkedIn if they are getting a lot of messages. It‚Äôs difficult to skim through messages and find genuine ones to reply to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the above mentioned problems with LinkedIn messaging are fairly common problems. I‚Äôm sure LinkedIn must already be aware of these. I hope LinkedIn product is already doing some things to solve this problem and I hope we get a better LinkedIn soon. In my opinion, LinkedIn product folks need to sit down, have devoted thought process, and make a strategy to improve UX of inbox. I‚Äôm sure they are analysing data around repeated spamming behaviour, % of messages replied by different kinds of users et al. LinkedIn also needs to chart out a plan to better educate users on messaging etiquettes. Personally, in the long term roadmap after filtering, labelling, auto-labelling for spam (I vote for Hi &lt;Random Name which is not my name&gt;‚Äù messages to directly land in spam), I also personally recommend them having rating for a conversation or user. I know this is very Black Mirror-ish but some accountability of the messages you send needs to be there for the larger good of users having smooth experience of skimming through messages and connecting genuinely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;network-and-connections&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#network-and-connections&quot; aria-label=&quot;network and connections permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Network and Connections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never understood the deal with LinkedIn connections. Why doesn‚Äôt LinkedIn move towards a follow only model like Twitter or Instagram (Only use case of Instagram private account with follow request is of one protecting one‚Äôs pictures from unknown users - I don‚Äôt think people on LinkedIn share something which would require protection or connection exclusivity)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don‚Äôt know about others but I get a lot of connection requests from people I know and people I don‚Äôt know (majorly the latter) and the only way I can do any filtering is on basis of my own school / organisation. This essentially means that I have to sit down with hours on my hand, go through each and every connection request and accept or reject. This is very time-consuming process and nobody in their sane mind would prefer doing, specially if the number of requests are too high. Besides, on a personal note, I feel bad about rejecting a request solely because rejection has a negative connotation and I feel who am I to judge somebody from their headline and decide what value they can provide in my career or vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the connection conundrum is something that LinkedIn product needs to sit down, brainstorm and take a call on. Of course, the answer may not be just ‚ÄúFollow‚Äù. Mutual follow does say a bidirectional connection. But, the answer is definitely not what is present currently on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;linkedin-content&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#linkedin-content&quot; aria-label=&quot;linkedin content permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;LinkedIn Content&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6715318992828993536-B31I/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;‚ÄòLinkedIn Influencers‚Äô by Lumko Solwandle from Nikhil Narayanan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admit it, you all knew what I was going to say just by looking at ‚ÄúLinkedIn Content‚Äù. The problem is that prevalent. This is a larger problem of content that most of the companies face in today‚Äôs time. Honestly, I am not certain how LinkedIn should or would tackle this problem because of lot of such content is liked by people. Most of my feed is full of motivational gibberish which sometimes makes me want to never open LinkedIn again. Maybe it‚Äôs partly because I have added a lot of random people I did not know in my connections and now it‚Äôs too painful to clean my feed. This is a definite problem. There is no single solution. My wild idea would be to introduce anonymous downvoting feature on LinkedIn to feed into ML model while personalising for users as well as promote better content and not promote certain people/influencer (generally higher up the ranks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;alright-if-i-have-so-many-problems-then-why-do-i-even-use-linkedin&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#alright-if-i-have-so-many-problems-then-why-do-i-even-use-linkedin&quot; aria-label=&quot;alright if i have so many problems then why do i even use linkedin permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor before&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Alright, if I have so many problems, then why do I even use LinkedIn?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have occasionally found genuine connections, conversations, content on LinkedIn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn is THE professional network. I don‚Äôt think there are any other giant professional networks like LinkedIn. Recently discovered Lunchclub, thanks to Abhishek Sethi and found it intriguing. Also, Twitter has also become a professional network to some extent, at least for certain cohorts of users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn, being the giant professional network it is, also helps in checking everyone‚Äôs profile and career trajectory. It‚Äôs one stop shop in case you‚Äôre wondering where your new colleague used to work or what kind of education does somebody require for Google APM role or which classmate of yours is doing what in life. Just looking at career trajectories can be inspiring. Technically, you can connect with relevant people you admire and get mentorship. Though I don‚Äôt think I have taken up on that offer till now on LinkedIn, majorly due to reasons listed above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LinkedIn is extremely useful as a job board. One can check out most recent job openings when one is searching for a job and find a way to apply. Also helps in looking up people in the same domain and/or company. Most of the recruiters also check out the candidate‚Äôs LinkedIn profile.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this, I want to conclude this rant about LinkedIn. I guess with this blog post originally being published on LinkedIn, #5 in the ‚ÄúLinkedIn good‚Äù list would be Blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I sit relieved yet relentless with excitement in Spicejet flight‚Äôs emergency exit doorway with way too much leg room which I was never aware Spicejet had, I ponder how things change in a few days. In fact, taking the liberty to rewind my memories a little bit more from a few days to a couple of years, I remember I had my flights booked to Bangalore in 2017. I remember always feeling Gurgaon was a 6-month-affair. But you never know and can never tell. The 6 months turned into 2.5 years. When people ask me if I do anything related to mechanical engineering at all, I look back to that day when I decided to not join core in Bangalore. I do not do anything directly related to mechanical engineering but still have an affinity to make ‚Äúactual‚Äù products. When I started at Gurgaon with zero friends, I never imagined I would land up with genuine bunch of folks - I never imagined I would make such close friends after college. Never imagined would transition from 4-sharing PG to a single room. Yet, somehow did. The change in me is tremendous and Gurgaon has been a part of that journey of change. Somehow will miss Gurgaon despite it being the world‚Äôs most polluted city and quite frankly full of TDCs.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will miss the wide roads, everything being at max 30 min away, the scorching heat and quivering cold, ability to speak to every Ola/Uber/Swiggy/Zomato/etcetc person, comfort zone due to familiarity of places and people, ability to pack bags and go to Jaipur on my terms and not dictated by when is flight cheaper. Delhi metro, though I didn‚Äôt use it as much as I could have. Above all, I will miss the people who made Gurgaon a bearable place for me from start. Can‚Äôt be grateful enough to have known the amazing people by coincidence or by destiny. Have a story around each one of them. Stories which has inspired me, stories of maturity, kindness. I wish I had met the people more often when I had the chance. Hope sometime some of our paths will cross again. Till that time, bye bye, Gurgaon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A long poem written by Shaista and I&lt;/em&gt; depicting the haphazard, clogged, jumbled up internal existential crisis. This poem is an attempt to address overarching dilemmas. It‚Äôs an attempt to ask the moral, philosophical and ethical questions. A world-full of people moving towards stress and anxiety, the poem asks some ignored questions. I hope our poem reaches some people asking difficult questions in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I these strings that bind me?&lt;br&gt;
Erasing my dreams that see&lt;br&gt;
But that can‚Äôt be for I can be free&lt;br&gt;
Then must I exist in my reverie?    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am I my body, my face, my hair?&lt;br&gt;
That is what attracts the most glare&lt;br&gt;
But how can that be me&lt;br&gt;
If I need to look at a mirror to see   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I must be a bit of her or him&lt;br&gt;
For I talk of their interests and them&lt;br&gt;
They built pieces of me like many more&lt;br&gt;
Can i be so many yet have my own core?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what might be the nature of my core&lt;br&gt;
Does it include my qualities like my quality of wanting more?&lt;br&gt;
Or is my core made of my philosophy, my principles, my morality?&lt;br&gt;
But what exactly are these in reality?&lt;br&gt;
Does there exist an SI unit of someone‚Äôs core?&lt;br&gt;
Because in life, I have seen immorable people soar&lt;br&gt;
The truthful, naive moral people others abhor   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But does it matter who they despise?&lt;br&gt;
Why should I ever chastise&lt;br&gt;
Virtues of mine were in my wise&lt;br&gt;
Not a stepping stone for me to rise&lt;br&gt;
Why then should I mourn their superiority?&lt;br&gt;
Is it not my heart‚Äôs depravity,&lt;br&gt;
To seek something of my purity&lt;br&gt;
Contradicting to a point of immorality?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I am the role I play in this world&lt;br&gt;
But isn‚Äôt this role just a role which at me life hurled?&lt;br&gt;
If I consider the world a big stage, what role do I anyway play?&lt;br&gt;
Am I just a passer-by to the billion lives or am I gonna stay?&lt;br&gt;
If I zoom out of my city, state, country, continent, planet and see the vast empty space&lt;br&gt;
Does it matter to the space what is my career pace?&lt;br&gt;
What is the reason for my existence?&lt;br&gt;
Is the reason just to ponder over this question with persistence?&lt;br&gt;
Am I just one of the million atoms floating around in the vast universe?&lt;br&gt;
Or am I the money gloating around in my tiny purse?&lt;br&gt;
They say people find soulmates and marry them&lt;br&gt;
They must be seeing my soul before marrying&lt;br&gt;
Then my soul must be defined by the money I am carrying   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or maybe I am too small to know&lt;br&gt;
The truth that runs all this show&lt;br&gt;
To keep the glory intact&lt;br&gt;
There are trifles that distract&lt;br&gt;
But how could I know if I fall&lt;br&gt;
A prey to these frivolity‚Äôs call   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me start by enslaving the master&lt;br&gt;
The mind that controls shall be the prisoner&lt;br&gt;
So that I can break out of the teachings&lt;br&gt;
Because it definitely triggers my musings&lt;br&gt;
Only when I unlearn will I begin to learn&lt;br&gt;
What my notions have kept hidden   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What defines me, I shall set free&lt;br&gt;
Hey me, It‚Äôs an open minded quest for thee&lt;br&gt;
Rather than blindly following the norms&lt;br&gt;
Thou shalt question everything in all the forms&lt;br&gt;
Thou shan‚Äôt have to follow the conventional cycle of life&lt;br&gt;
Birth, Studies, Job, and then a wife   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of unlearning is more difficult than learning&lt;br&gt;
Sitting idle is more difficult than earning&lt;br&gt;
Squeezing the paste inside is more difficult than taking it out&lt;br&gt;
Being silent is more powerful than your shout&lt;br&gt;
Forgetting something is more difficult than creating memories&lt;br&gt;
Writing a poem is less expensive than a therapist‚Äôs fees   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am learning to unlearn what I earlier learnt&lt;br&gt;
Not use the fancy words, I want to be blunt&lt;br&gt;
The existential crisis that has become the common identity&lt;br&gt;
A place where you are judged by your prosperity&lt;br&gt;
Not your perspective but your money matters&lt;br&gt;
Not your morals but your gold chatters&lt;br&gt;
We are a population divided by money but united by existential crisis&lt;br&gt;
Who is it sitting in the sky playing the dices?&lt;br&gt;
My cluttered thoughts are turning a tad bit more into a clutter&lt;br&gt;
They are following the pattern of a naive butterfly‚Äôs flutter   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although my mind is still a muddle&lt;br&gt;
And I have no answer to life‚Äôs puzzle&lt;br&gt;
I‚Äôve learnt to find order in the chaos&lt;br&gt;
Taking each day as the life throws    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gibberish I see is a pattern&lt;br&gt;
Which can only be seen if I leave my dark cavern&lt;br&gt;
If I zoom out for a second and try to see&lt;br&gt;
The beautiful pattern is always smiling at me&lt;br&gt;
The nature has it all figured out&lt;br&gt;
It does the best for us, without a doubt&lt;br&gt;
For sudden turns, everyone curse, blame, cry and everyone clings&lt;br&gt;
Only to later realise the greater scheme of things&lt;br&gt;
You can‚Äôt see the design and you whine&lt;br&gt;
You are the ant which sees from the FOV nature assign&lt;br&gt;
But someday you will realise&lt;br&gt;
All your life events are a boon in disguise&lt;br&gt;
All that happens with you, has a purpose and a noble reason&lt;br&gt;
If there is winter, always comes a  spring season   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait, is it a validation that I seek from others&lt;br&gt;
Is that why I live, my being shudders&lt;br&gt;
A person telling me that yes, I am insanely good&lt;br&gt;
Isn‚Äôt that all we seek in adulthood&lt;br&gt;
Do I just seek an acceptance in this society&lt;br&gt;
A boost to my ego and my vanity&lt;br&gt;
Maybe that is why I do inhuman things- to gel well&lt;br&gt;
Because gel-ing well is more important that skipping hell&lt;br&gt;
Does my whole sense of being revolve around looking cool&lt;br&gt;
If my life is a car, is admiration the only fuel?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, any interesting analogy of my life being a car!&lt;br&gt;
Fuel stations may sometimes be near and sometimes far&lt;br&gt;
The fuel may be a happy memory, a tiny success, a good conversation&lt;br&gt;
Something which keeps me going till the next station&lt;br&gt;
A constant love amounts a lot&lt;br&gt;
If something feels right, it‚Äôs worth a shot&lt;br&gt;
A bumpy ride sometimes till I hit the highway road&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes the fuel might end and I may need to be towed&lt;br&gt;
Sometimes all I require is a small push or kick start acceleration&lt;br&gt;
A push which leads me to my destination&lt;br&gt;
Or maybe just sends me to next station   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mind, you see, is full of chaos&lt;br&gt;
The universe might have said ‚ÄúYou want me to increase entropy? - Here goes‚Äù&lt;br&gt;
I wonder if the stable mind is better than a chaotic one&lt;br&gt;
I wonder how does the stable one have some fun&lt;br&gt;
Or maybe it is a matter of multiple states of mind&lt;br&gt;
Where it goes through happiness, sadness and rewind   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lack of reference frame renders the question ‚ÄúWho am I‚Äù pointless&lt;br&gt;
Who is supposed to answer - you need to address&lt;br&gt;
For a wife, you are a husband&lt;br&gt;
For a friend, you are a friend&lt;br&gt;
For a daughter, you are a mother&lt;br&gt;
For a sister, you are a brother   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the question is aimed at you, yourself&lt;br&gt;
Its a loop within a loop itself&lt;br&gt;
You can‚Äôt say ‚Äòto publish something‚Äô is definition of ‚Äòpublication‚Äô&lt;br&gt;
You don‚Äôt say ‚Äòto converse‚Äô means ‚Äòhaving a conversation‚Äô&lt;br&gt;
I am asking myself that who am I&lt;br&gt;
If I know where my thoughts generate, it will simplify&lt;br&gt;
Where am I actually expecting the answer from is the answer in itself&lt;br&gt;
Which component is answering that within myself&lt;br&gt;
Maybe I am my brain, or maybe I am my mind&lt;br&gt;
Where is this thought originating from is what I need to find&lt;br&gt;
I maybe am my heart, or maybe my conscience&lt;br&gt;
Or maybe I will find out with some advancements in science   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing I know for sure is that I am deeper than my skin&lt;br&gt;
A vessel and what‚Äôs inside the vessel can not always be akin&lt;br&gt;
Although the structure or material might tell you a lot or might not&lt;br&gt;
It‚Äôs definitely not all what a vessel has got&lt;br&gt;
But I wonder why we put all our time to keep the vessel shining&lt;br&gt;
Why not spend more time in thinking and thoughts mining&lt;br&gt;
Maybe because nobody is ready to climb up and peep inside the vessel&lt;br&gt;
As it may be causing a lot of hassle&lt;br&gt;
Every hemisphere requires another one to complete a closed sphere&lt;br&gt;
Maybe being with someone is the law of nature and it‚Äôs only fair&lt;br&gt;
I would have left my thoughts to wander more, but I do not dare&lt;br&gt;
In getting distracted, I have a natural flair   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe the distraction is the real order and the real order a distraction&lt;br&gt;
Maybe a dream is a reality and reality a dream in action&lt;br&gt;
At this point, I think I should take a bath&lt;br&gt;
To save myself from my mother‚Äôs telephonic wrath&lt;br&gt;
Hopefully, I have confused you a lot&lt;br&gt;
You‚Äôll miss me in the 2050 - the world of bot!   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;Hello darkness, my old friend. &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A peom written by me&lt;/em&gt; telling the story of a young girl. ‚ÄòNearly four out of five women in India have faced public harassment ranging from staring, insults and wolf-whistling to being followed, groped or even raped‚Äô, said a survey by the charity ActionAid UK in 2016. The poem tries to bring out a story of one such shattering experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúI want to eat panipuri, Mummy‚Äù&lt;br&gt;
14-year old said, holding her tummy&lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúCan we go to that roadside shop?&lt;br&gt;
It‚Äôs not even late‚Äù she motioned at the clock   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ‚ÄúI have work to do‚Äù her mother said,&lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúGo by yourself‚Äù she added while dusting the bed&lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúOkay fine, I‚Äôll go by myself‚Äù the girl replied&lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúI am a big girl‚Äù she declared with some pride  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  She wore a sweater and left to eat&lt;br&gt;
Panipuri- Something no eatable can beat&lt;br&gt;
She reached the shop and ate&lt;br&gt;
7 o-clock, still not that late  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Just entered her street, she was returning back&lt;br&gt;
Walked some steps and a man on cycle passed, taking her aback&lt;br&gt;
In a flash of second, she just stood there&lt;br&gt;
Trying to understand the air.&lt;br&gt;
It took her a second to solve the quest&lt;br&gt;
Feeling some pain in her left breast&lt;br&gt;
The man had grabbed it tight&lt;br&gt;
She felt herself turning pale white&lt;br&gt;
She managed to turn back in shock&lt;br&gt;
Just to see the man smiling as slowly she walk  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  His cycle disappeared with the turn of road&lt;br&gt;
The only thing on that street now was an ad board&lt;br&gt;
She felt uneasy as tears rolled down&lt;br&gt;
Not knowing what to do, or say, or should she frown?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  She walked as slowly as the teardrops rolled&lt;br&gt;
Reached her home and door she bolt&lt;br&gt;
Her mother asked her what happened, becoming tense&lt;br&gt;
She narrated and her tears turned more intense  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  Her mother furiously went on to say&lt;br&gt;
‚ÄúYou should have shouted, should have hold him in the way‚Äù&lt;br&gt;
And a hundred condolences and advices&lt;br&gt;
On how to handle such crisis&lt;br&gt;
All she thought was to never go out alone again&lt;br&gt;
But her brain declared that would just be insane  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  In a day, she went back to normal but learned to see&lt;br&gt;
How a person becomes what he/she set out to be  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  There is evil, pain, there is blue&lt;br&gt;
There is evil, pain, there is blue&lt;br&gt;
There are shattering experiences too&lt;br&gt;
One has to emerge out of those a winner&lt;br&gt;
Not to be crushed but some sinner  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  In a country of largest number of rape victims&lt;br&gt;
In a country of poor judiciary systems&lt;br&gt;
You cannot live in fear, you have got to be strong&lt;br&gt;
Sitting in a locked up room would just be wrong.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
