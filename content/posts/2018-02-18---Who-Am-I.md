description: "A beautifully long poem written by Shaista and I depicting the haphazard, clogged, jumbled up internal existential crisis in our minds. This poem is an attempt to address overarching dilemmas, attempt to ask the moral, philosophical and ethical questions. A world-full of people moving towards increasing stress and anxiety, the poem lists down all ignored questions which may give a sense of relief to some of you that you're not alone asking yourself all these random questions. Maybe we're together in the unknown. Maybe we're together in this dilemma. I hope this reaches some people looking for answers to difficult questions in life or just reaches people looking for others asking the same questions.  "

!["Kyuki badal important hain" - Zakir Khan"](/media/image-2.jpg)

Am I these strings that bind me?   
Erasing my dreams that see   
But that can't be for I can be free 
Then must I exist in my reverie? 

 
Am I my body, my face, my hair?  

That is what attracts the most glare 
But how can that be me 
If I need to look at a mirror to see 

 
Then I must be a bit of her or him 

For I talk of their interests and them 
They built pieces of me like many more 
Can i be so many yet have my own core? 

 
I wonder what might be the nature of my core 

Does it include my qualities like my quality of wanting more? 
Or is my core made of my philosophy, my principles, my morality?  
But what exactly are these in reality? 
Does there exist an SI unit of someone’s core? 
Because in life, I have seen immorable people soar 
The truthful, naive moral people others abhor 

 
But does it matter who they despise? 

Why should I ever chastise 
Virtues of mine were in my wise 
Not a stepping stone for me to rise 
Why then should I mourn their superiority? 
Is it not my heart’s depravity, 
To seek something of my purity 
Contradicting to a point of immorality? 

 
Maybe I am the role I play in this world 

But isn’t this role just a role which at me life hurled? 
If I consider the world a big stage, what role do I anyway play? 
Am I just a passer-by to the billion lives or am I gonna stay? 
If I zoom out of my city, state, country, continent, planet and see the vast empty space 
Does it matter to the space what is my career pace? 
What is the reason for my existence? 
Is the reason just to ponder over this question with persistence?  
Am I just one of the million atoms floating around in the vast universe? 
Or am I the money gloating around in my tiny purse? 
They say people find soulmates and marry them 
They must be seeing my soul before marrying 
Then my soul must be defined by the money I am carrying 

 
Or maybe I am too small to know 

The truth that runs all this show 
To keep the glory intact 
There are trifles that distract 
But how could I know if I fall 
A prey to these frivolity’s call 

 
Let me start by enslaving the master 

The mind that controls shall be the prisoner 
So that I can break out of the teachings 
Because it definitely triggers my musings 
Only when I unlearn will I begin to learn 
What my notions have kept hidden 

 
What defines me, I shall set free 

Hey me, It’s an open minded quest for thee 
Rather than blindly following the norms 
Thou shalt question everything in all the forms 
Thou shan’t have to follow the conventional cycle of life 
Birth, Studies, Job, and then a wife 

 
The process of unlearning is more difficult than learning 

Sitting idle is more difficult than earning 
Squeezing the paste inside is more difficult than taking it out 
Being silent is more powerful than your shout 
Forgetting something is more difficult than creating memories 
Writing a poem is less expensive than a therapist's fees 

 
I am learning to unlearn what I earlier learnt 

Not use the fancy words, I want to be blunt 
The existential crisis that has become the common identity 
A place where you are judged by your prosperity 
Not your perspective but your money matters 
Not your morals but your gold chatters 
We are a population divided by money but united by existential crisis 
Who is it sitting in the sky playing the dices? 
My cluttered thoughts are turning a tad bit more into a clutter 
They are following the pattern of a naive butterfly’s flutter 

 
Although my mind is still a muddle 

And I have no answer to life's puzzle 
I've learnt to find order in the chaos 
Taking each day as the life throws  

 
The gibberish I see is a pattern 

Which can only be seen if I leave my dark cavern 
If I zoom out for a second and try to see 
The beautiful pattern is always smiling at me 
The nature has it all figured out 
It does the best for us, without a doubt 
For sudden turns, everyone curse, blame, cry and everyone clings 
Only to later realise the greater scheme of things 
You can't see the design and you whine 
You are the ant which sees from the FOV nature assign 
But someday you will realise 
All your life events are a boon in disguise 
All that happens with you, has a purpose and a noble reason 
If there is winter, always comes a  spring season 

 
Wait, is it a validation that I seek from others 

Is that why I live, my being shudders 
A person telling me that yes, I am insanely good 
Isn’t that all we seek in adulthood 
Do I just seek an acceptance in this society 
A boost to my ego and my vanity 
Maybe that is why I do inhuman things- to gel well 
Because gel-ing well is more important that skipping hell 
Does my whole sense of being revolve around looking cool 
If my life is a car, is admiration the only fuel? 

 
Ah, any interesting analogy of my life being a car! 

Fuel stations may sometimes be near and sometimes far 
The fuel may be a happy memory, a tiny success, a good conversation 
Something which keeps me going till the next station 
A constant love amounts a lot 
If something feels right, it’s worth a shot 
A bumpy ride sometimes till I hit the highway road 
Sometimes the fuel might end and I may need to be towed 
Sometimes all I require is a small push or kick start acceleration 
A push which leads me to my destination 
Or maybe just sends me to next station 

 
My mind, you see, is full of chaos 

The universe might have said “You want me to increase entropy? - Here goes” 
I wonder if the stable mind is better than a chaotic one 
I wonder how does the stable one have some fun 
Or maybe it is a matter of multiple states of mind 
Where it goes through happiness, sadness and rewind 

 
Lack of reference frame renders the question “Who am I” pointless 

Who is supposed to answer - you need to address 
For a wife, you are a husband 
For a friend, you are a friend 
For a daughter, you are a mother 
For a sister, you are a brother 

 
If the question is aimed at you, yourself 

Its a loop within a loop itself 
You can’t say ‘to publish something’ is definition of ‘publication’ 
You don’t say ‘to converse’ means ‘having a conversation’ 
I am asking myself that who am I 
If I know where my thoughts generate, it will simplify 
Where am I actually expecting the answer from is the answer in itself 
Which component is answering that within myself 
Maybe I am my brain, or maybe I am my mind 
Where is this thought originating from is what I need to find 
I maybe am my heart, or maybe my conscience 
Or maybe I will find out with some advancements in science 

 
But one thing I know for sure is that I am deeper than my skin 

A vessel and what’s inside the vessel can not always be akin 
Although the structure or material might tell you a lot or might not 
It’s definitely not all what a vessel has got 
But I wonder why we put all our time to keep the vessel shining 
Why not spend more time in thinking and thoughts mining 
Maybe because nobody is ready to climb up and peep inside the vessel 
As it may be causing a lot of hassle 
Every hemisphere requires another one to complete a closed sphere 
Maybe being with someone is the law of nature and it’s only fair 
I would have left my thoughts to wander more, but I do not dare 
In getting distracted, I have a natural flair 

 
Maybe the distraction is the real order and the real order a distraction 

Maybe a dream is a reality and reality a dream in action 
At this point, I think I should take a bath 
To save myself from my mother’s telephonic wrath 
Hopefully, I have confused you a lot 
You’ll miss me in the 2050 - the world of bot!
