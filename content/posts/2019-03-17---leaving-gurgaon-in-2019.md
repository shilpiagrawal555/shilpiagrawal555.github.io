This is a short personal note I wrote when I moved to Bangalore from Gurgaon. Gurgaon, of course, has always topped the pollution charts but this note summarizes what it meant for me.

As I sit relieved yet relentless with excitement in Spicejet flight's emergency exit doorway with way too much leg room which I was never aware Spicejet had, I ponder how things change in a few days. In fact, taking the liberty to rewind my memories a little bit more from a few days to a couple of years, I remember I had my flights booked to Bangalore in 2017. I remember always feeling Gurgaon was a 6-month-affair. But you never know and can never tell. The 6 months turned into 2.5 years. When people ask me if I do anything related to mechanical engineering at all, I look back to that day when I decided to not join core in Bangalore. I do not do anything directly related to mechanical engineering but still have an affinity to make "actual" products. When I started at Gurgaon with zero friends, I never imagined I would land up with genuine bunch of folks - I never imagined I would make such close friends after college. Never imagined would transition from 4-sharing PG to a single room. Yet, somehow did. The change in me is tremendous and Gurgaon has been a part of that journey of change. Somehow will miss Gurgaon despite it being the world's most polluted city and quite frankly full of TDCs.   

Will miss the wide roads, everything being at max 30 min away, the scorching heat and quivering cold, ability to speak to every Ola/Uber/Swiggy/Zomato/etcetc person, comfort zone due to familiarity of places and people, ability to pack bags and go to Jaipur on my terms and not dictated by when is flight cheaper. Delhi metro, though I didn't use it as much as I could have. Above all, I will miss the people who made Gurgaon a bearable place for me from start. Can't be grateful enough to have known the amazing people by coincidence or by destiny. Have a story around each one of them. Stories which has inspired me, stories of maturity, kindness. I wish I had met the people more often when I had the chance. Hope sometime some of our paths will cross again. Till that time, bye bye, Gurgaon.
