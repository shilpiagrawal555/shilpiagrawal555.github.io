_A peom written by me_ telling the story of a young girl. 'Nearly four out of five women in India have faced public harassment ranging from staring, insults and wolf-whistling to being followed, groped or even raped', said a survey by the charity ActionAid UK in 2016. The poem tries to bring out a story of one such shattering experience.


<div align="center">

“I want to eat panipuri, Mummy”   
14-year old said, holding her tummy   
“Can we go to that roadside shop?   
It’s not even late” she motioned at the clock   

 “I have work to do” her mother said,  
“Go by yourself” she added while dusting the bed  
“Okay fine, I’ll go by myself” the girl replied  
“I am a big girl” she declared with some pride  

  She wore a sweater and left to eat  
Panipuri- Something no eatable can beat  
She reached the shop and ate  
7 o-clock, still not that late  

  Just entered her street, she was returning back  
Walked some steps and a man on cycle passed, taking her aback  
In a flash of second, she just stood there  
Trying to understand the air.  
It took her a second to solve the quest  
Feeling some pain in her left breast  
The man had grabbed it tight  
She felt herself turning pale white  
She managed to turn back in shock  
Just to see the man smiling as slowly she walk  

  His cycle disappeared with the turn of road  
The only thing on that street now was an ad board  
She felt uneasy as tears rolled down  
Not knowing what to do, or say, or should she frown?  

  She walked as slowly as the teardrops rolled  
Reached her home and door she bolt  
Her mother asked her what happened, becoming tense  
She narrated and her tears turned more intense  

  Her mother furiously went on to say  
“You should have shouted, should have hold him in the way”  
And a hundred condolences and advices  
On how to handle such crisis  
All she thought was to never go out alone again  
But her brain declared that would just be insane  

  
  In a day, she went back to normal but learned to see  
How a person becomes what he/she set out to be  

  There is evil, pain, there is blue  
There is evil, pain, there is blue  
There are shattering experiences too  
One has to emerge out of those a winner  
Not to be crushed but some sinner  

  In a country of largest number of rape victims  
In a country of poor judiciary systems   
You cannot live in fear, you have got to be strong  
Sitting in a locked up room would just be wrong.
