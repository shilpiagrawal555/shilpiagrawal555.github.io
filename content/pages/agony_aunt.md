<h3>Letter from eternally confused</h3>
<p>You are doing gods work. I have some so much agony angst frustration with not being able to decide direction of my life. 

I don't know how to plan so that me, my kids, my love life, my career and my parents and my ambitions turn out fine in life lol. 

choosing career is so hard. making money is hard too.</p>

<h3>Letter from XYZ</h3>
<p>its weird but the most problematic thing in my life is my own parents . they keep fighting all day , have their own problems which i cannot solve (only they can ) but i listen to it all day . i have been going through this since childhood , my siblings as well . our lives have been affected by it a lot . they never saw what problems their children are going through at school or college . its just about marks or salary that we are talking about .
i recently gave my jee . during my preparation days my mother left me here with my father for 2 months(jan and feb) , it was my drop year so she thought i was free . i had to do all the housework as my father has 12 -13 hours job he does get any time . also there was no maid.
i hardly used to get 4 hours free time to study , where i used to be so tired. also she always used to tell everyone that my daughter does not do any household work , while she used to keep me busy in it . i dont know how to explain but she just fucked up with my brain. never asked me how was my preparation was going . now i didnot clear it , going to a private college not a nit ot iit , she is blaming me all day .
also during my 11 and 12 they never asked me what tuitions i m going to , i went to none in 11th , took in 12th but always had to like beg for the fee . and now they want results !
