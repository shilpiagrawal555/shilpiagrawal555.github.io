<h2>Personally</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">

My friends sometimes think I am fattu. 

I am an Indian female (she/her) mechanical (actually manufacturing) engineer who studied from BITS Pilani Pilani Campus and later became a product manager for 6+ yrs starting 2017 and relocated to Ireland on my own at the age of 27 without pursuing an MS/MBA without any friends or family for 6 months and decided to take a career break which stretched to 1 year+ (in which i did 2 entrepreneurial stints and standup comedy) and now I am starting to freelance a little with more risky career paths exploration planned in (far) future. Also, I have more information stored in my brain than you can imagine and i know everything a normal indian 90s internet nerd guy would know+ a lot of bio physics and whatnot ‚Äî for eg 2g1c, how gut heath works and what really is metabolism or triceps. 

I am sure braveness/risk taking isn‚Äôt my P0 problem to solve.
